title = KE-G35 Kethoelectric Reactor Unit
manufacturer = Organization of Kethane Equipment Producers
description = Constructed from fragments of destroyed solar panels, the KE-G35 is a remarkably efficient Kethane-powered electrical generator. The exhaust manifold captures and stores some of the Xenon gas dissolved in the fuel, making this a versatile unit for exploration and drilling. The generator automatically regulates its output in order to save fuel.
